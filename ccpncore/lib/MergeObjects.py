"""MOdule for generic merging of data model objects
Transfers simple and link attributes from the source object to target object
Does not transfer derived, automatic or immutable attributes
Links will be transferred where possible
Where necessary the Api is bypassed

Logical analysis and design by R.H. Fogh

Coding and testing by T.J. Stevens

Definitions:
Objects targetObj and sourceObj of class O
link O.a (a) to class A, with backlink A.o ( o)

A note on checks:
Where the API is bypassed, the function does validity checks at each step,
and rolls back the last step if the checks fail.
The checks are done on sourceObj, targetObj, objects on the other end of
links, and the parents of the latter. The check on parents is done because
this includes a check on the keys of the children - the merge cannot change
the keys of either source or target, but can change the key of linked-to objects.

  """Merges sourceObj into targetObj, deleting sourceObj.
  Attributes and links from sourceObj are added to targetObj
  provided 1) that they are not there already, and  
  2) that there is room.
  
  WARNING this function bypasses the API.

  WARNING Merging objects with child links or frozen links is NOT undoable
   and undo stack is cleared

  WARNING, integrated update operations, e.g. Chemical Shift averaging
  and notifiers are NOT reliably performed during merging and must be
  handled by the callign function

  WARNING This function just might leave the data in an illegal state
  The function performs a number of checks for each individual change.
  If a check fails, the latest change is undone before the error exit,
  in an attempt to leave the data in a state that is legal. Note that only
  the latest change is undone - in case of error the data state will not be
  brought back to the state from before the execution of the command.
  Note that sourceObj is likely to be in an illegal state during execution,
  so that an error may well leave sourceObj in an illegal state. If this happens,
  deleting sourceObj may bring the data back to a legal state, and is unlikely 
  to cause further problems.
  In spite of the checks, some objects (not limited to sourceObj and targetObj)
  may be left in an illegal state, even if no error is raised.
  It is recommended to use this function with caution, 
  and to run checkAllValid after it has been used.  """
