# CCPN license
CcpnLicense = """
Definitions:
- CCPN: The Collaborative Computing Project for Nuclear magnetic resonance

- CCPN Software: Software authored by CCPN and covered by this licence.

- Workplace: The laboratory, group, or work unit where CCPN software is used.

- Organisation: The legal entity that includes the Workplace or that profits
  from the use of the CCPN software. The licence may be expanded to cover
  affiliate organisations, by prior written agreement with CCPN.

- CCPN member: A person that has signed up for CCPN membership and that currently
  fulfils the conditions for membership.

- Premium member: A CCPN member that has signed up for premium membership. Premium
  members are given higher priority with respect to assistance, problem solving,
  and attention to feature requests. Premium members are charged a higher fee,
  negotiated for each individual case.

Fees:
Membership fees are not applicable to non-profit Organisations.
Membership of people working for a for-profit Organisation shall be based on
registration of the Organisation and the corresponding payment of an annual fee,
which may be reviewed from time to time. The current scale of fees can be
found at  http://www.ccpn.ac.uk.

Licence:
In using or acquiring CCPN software each person implicitly accepts the following
requirements and conditions:

1. The person acquiring or using this software is authorized by his Workplace and
Organisation to commit to this agreement, which is binding on this person, this
person's Workplace, Organisation, and all other persons and institutions with whom
CCPN software is shared.

2. This agreement covers all CCPN software in any form, including source or binary
code, programs or program fragments, updates, patches, bug fixes, and additions.
The provisions in this licence do not, however, apply to software that is explicitly
distributed under a different licence, such as the GNU LGPL license, provided that
the alternative license is clearly reflected in the individual files that it covers.

3. Only CCPN members are allowed to acquire CCPN software except as detailed under
point 7).

4. In order to become a CCPN member it is necessary to register; registration can
be found at the CCPN web site http://www.ccpn.ac.uk. CCPN membership will cease to
be valid if the records of contact details and current Workplace are not kept
current by the member.

5. CCPN may charge a fee for CCPN membership. Currently membership is free, except
for individuals working for a for-profit Organisation. It is a condition of
membership that all applicable fees have been paid. CCPN membership is for an
individual person, but fees are charged per Organisation. A single fee paid by an
Organisation will enable membership of any individual working for the Organisation
for a one year period. In order to allow acquisition of CCPN software, there must
be at least one CCPN member for each Workplace that acquires the new software.

6. When a CCPN member works for more than one Organisation, any fees charged are
considered separately for the different Organisations and their corresponding
Workplaces within which CCPN software is acquired and used.

7. Once acquired by a CCPN member in a given Workplace, CCPN software may be shared
with others working in the same Workplace.

8. For the purpose of assessing CCPN software, an individual may use CCPN software
during training courses and when visiting Organisations, for which they do not
work, without being a CCPN member.

9. Except as stated in 7) CCPN software, whether in whole or in part, modified or
unmodified, may not be redistributed in any way, except within the current
Workplace of a current CCPN member.

10. A Workplace that has legally acquired CCPN software, but that no longer contains
a current member of CCPN, may continue to use the software, and may modify it for
internal use, but may not acquire new software or distribute the CCPN software to
others.

11. When CCPN is able to give help and advice on the use of CCPN software any
assistance will be prioritised for current CCPN members.

12. CCPN software is provided 'as is' and is without warranties, expressed or implied,
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness
for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement. The authors will not be
held liable for any use you make of the software.

13. Acknowledgement shall be made in all publications resulting from the use of CCPN
software.
